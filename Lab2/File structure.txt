The structure of the file:
Line 1 : the states (as groups of characters - a state cannot contain a space in its name). Delimeted by space.
Line 2: The alphabet: delimeted by space
Line 3: The initial state (same restriction for state name)
Line 4: The final states (same restrictions as for Line 1)
Line > 5: The transition functions (one on each line). Must have the form qi,e,qj, where qi,qj are states and e is an element in the alphabet.


Implementation
The state is represented as a class which contains the MultiMap for the transitions and the name.
